# oak-d_light_playground
The oak-d_light_playground repository on GitHub serves as an exploration hub for experimenting with the functionality of the oak-d camera.

## Usage
To execute the code in this repo, ensure the necessary libraries (`cv2` and `depthai`) are installed. You also need a Oak-d lite camera.

## hello_world

This code demonstrates how to capture and display frames from a monocular camera using the DepthAI library and OpenCV in Python. The DepthAI library facilitates complex computer vision pipelines and is particularly suited for depth perception tasks.

This code serves as a basic framework for capturing and displaying monocular camera feed. Additional functionalities such as image processing or depth estimation can be incorporated within the frame processing section.
